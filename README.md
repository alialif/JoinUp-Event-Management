# JoinUp - AI-Generated Events Management System

**🤖 100% AI-Generated Application**

This full-stack web application was entirely generated using Artificial Intelligence as part of the AI Bootcamp Sherbrooke 2025. The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a comprehensive testing ground for **automated software testing practices**, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing scenarios.

The application manages events with features such as member registration, attendance tracking, and automated certificate generation with QR code validation.

## ⚠️ Project Purpose

This system was created specifically to:
- Demonstrate AI capabilities in full-stack application development
- Provide a realistic codebase for practicing test automation
- Serve as a learning platform for QA engineers and developers
- Showcase modern web development patterns generated by AI

## Branding

The application uses JoinUp branding with custom images:
- **Logo**: `joinup_logo.png` - Displayed on login page
- **Favicon**: `joinup_favicon.png` - Browser icon and header logo
- **Background**: `joinup_background.png` - Watermark throughout the site

All brand assets are located in `frontend/public/` directory.

## Testing

This application was designed specifically for practicing automated software testing. The codebase includes comprehensive test coverage:

### Backend Tests
```bash
cd backend
npm test           # Run all unit tests
npm run test:e2e   # Run integration tests
npm run test:cov   # Generate coverage report
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test           # Run unit tests (Jest)
npm run test:watch # Run tests in watch mode
```

### E2E Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm run e2e        # Run Cypress end-to-end tests
```

### Testing Focus Areas
- **Unit Tests**: Service methods, business logic, utilities
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints, database operations
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows (login, registration, event creation)
- **Component Tests**: Angular components in isolation
- **API Contract Tests**: Request/response validation

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`backend/.env`)
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=  # Optional: custom Chrome path
```

## Security

- JWT tokens expire after 24h
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Role-based guards on protected endpoints
- SQLite transactions for data integrity

## Deployment

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run build
node dist/main.js
```

### Frontend
